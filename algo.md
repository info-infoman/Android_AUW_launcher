# new generation algo:
1) Miners generate a new block(Wins as usual the most difficult hash) where the reward is calculated using the formula = ((Current award size) / 100) * (Number of coins in circulation) / ((Number of coins in the coin base) / 100) + fee. 
The rest of the reward network raffles between the network accounts on which there are coins. 
2) account who have a coin > MIN_BALANCE have the right to participate in the drawing of portions of new coins from the coin base
3) the drawing takes place by publicizing the rating where the first place is the address hash number of which is closest to the hash number (reduced to the address format) of the found block
4) reward payment is a mandatory transaction in the next block after the draw
5) The initial address of the developer is the first address to which the first coins will be transferred, 
further since the developer does not make sense to play with himself (money, if you donâ€™t spend it on purchases, lose all meaning) all new and new players will enter the game ...
6) The number of coins distributed in the network even if you distribute them one satoshi per public key is incomparably 
less than the number of possible options hash of the numbers of blocks and the hash of numbers of addresses, 
therefore, the probability that a person having a million addresses with the minimum number of coins will not have a greater chance of winning
7) Miners do not strive to sharply connect the power to the network as the reward increases gradually with increasing complexity, 
raising the complexity at the beginning of the path also does not make sense because the reward is minimal, 
for this reason the network becomes vulnerable to attack 51, but the users themselves must resist receive the bulk of the reward at the beginning of the journey.
Thus, through the drawing of coins, we sponsor randomly the owners of addresses to join in the mining process, 
in order for them to try to attack the network themselves, such random micro attacks will ultimately lead to an increase in the complexity and impossibility of such an attack from the side. 
The network seems to say "Hey, attack me, everyone!" everyone starts attacking (through the attack 51 to buy goods and at the same time save coins for the rally) and the difficulty grows.
